# Replication scripts

First, note the dependencies in [README_dependencies.md](README_dependencies.md).

## Online Appendix

Separately, replication scripts for the additional results in the Online Appendix appear in [README_replication_appendix.md](README_replication_appendix.md). It may be easier to go through these initially to get an overall sense of how the various pieces fit together, since it is a much smaller set of experiments. The FCE and BEA 2019 scripts illustrate the core zero-shot detection functionality, and the CoNLL scripts additionally show how to fine-tune the base model for supervised labeling and how to approximate the model with a K-NN, as with the experiments in the main text, below. (The only main method not demonstrated in the above scripts is the generation of aggregate feature summaries.)
