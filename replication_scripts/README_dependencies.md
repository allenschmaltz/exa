# Dependencies

1. To get started, you will need to install version 0.6.2 of the HuggingFace transformer repo. I've included a copy [here](../code/transformer_version/pytorch-pretrained-BERT-master.zip). Unpack the directory and install, as with

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

2. The main code has been most recently tested with the following versions of the additional required dependencies:
  * Python 3.7.10
  * torch 1.8.1
  * gensim '3.8.0'
  * sklearn '0.24.1'
  * numpy '1.20.2'

3. For applicable experiments, the pre-trained Word2Vec word embeddings of Mikolov et al. (2013) can be downloaded from [https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/), which has a link to a compressed copy of the file (`GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz`). Similarly, the GloVe embeddings (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014), used for a subset of experiments for comparison to certain previous models, are available here: [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The GloVe embeddings need to be converted to word2vec format using gensim (see above dependencies), as follows:

```
python -m gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec --input glove.6B.300d.txt --output glove.6B.300d.txt.word2vec_format.txt
```

The file `glove.6B.300d.txt.word2vec_format.txt` can then be used during training as the argument to `--word_embeddings_file` when used in conjunction with the `--word_embeddings_file_in_plaintext` flag.
